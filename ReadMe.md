# Before Executing any Task #
Before you can actually execute any task using this GUI, you will need to visit [OpenBiomind homepage](http://code.google.com/p/openbiomind/) and download the latest release of the OpenBiomind `jar`. You will also need the `pipeline.properties` file. The easiest way to get this is to download the OpenBiomind extras available at the same location.

Next, you must set these two files as the `Preferences` of the OpenBiomind-GUI (`Window > Preferences > OpenBiomind`). Now, you are ready to execute the tasks.

Optionally, if you wish the application to automatically convert the [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) `dot` files into images, you must separately download and install Graphviz from http://www.graphviz.org/ and then set the `dot` utility in the preferences.
